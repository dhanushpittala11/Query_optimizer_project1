# Distributed Database Query Optimizer

This project implements a basic query optimizer for a simulated distributed database using C++. It demonstrates cost-based optimization to select the best execution plan for a query.

## Features
- Simulated distributed database with two nodes.
- Cost-based query optimization.
- Query execution based on the selected plan.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o query_optimizer

2. Run the Executable:
   ```bash
   ./query_optimizer
